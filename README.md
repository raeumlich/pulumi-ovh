# OVH Resource Provider

The OVH Resource Provider lets you manage resources and services provided by
[OVHcloud](http://ovhcloud.com). You **cannot** use this provider to manage
resources on their public cloud offering. The public cloud uses OpenStack and
therefore the
[OpenStack provider](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/openstack/) should
be used fo that.
